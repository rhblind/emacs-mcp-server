;;; Commentary:

;; This module is a placeholder for TCP socket transport for the MCP server.
;; Implementation follows the same pattern as Unix socket transport but
;; uses TCP sockets for network connectivity.
;;
;; TODO: Implement full TCP transport functionality
;; TODO: Add TLS/SSL support for secure connections
;; TODO: Add authentication mechanisms
;; TODO: Add configuration for bind address and port ranges

;;; Future Implementation Notes

;; When implementing TCP transport, consider:
;;
;; 1. Security:
;;    - TLS/SSL support for encrypted connections
;;    - Authentication mechanisms (tokens, certificates)
;;    - Rate limiting and connection limits
;;    - IP-based access control
;;
;; 2. Configuration:
;;    - Configurable bind address (0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1, specific IP)
;;    - Port range specification or automatic port selection
;;    - Connection timeout settings
;;    - Buffer size configurations
;;
;; 3. Network Considerations:
;;    - Proper handling of network errors and timeouts
;;    - Graceful degradation on network issues
;;    - Support for IPv6
;;    - NAT/firewall considerations
;;
;; 4. Client Management:
;;    - Per-client authentication state
;;    - Connection tracking and logging
;;    - Bandwidth monitoring
;;    - Client capability negotiation
;;
;; 5. Integration:
;;    - Service discovery mechanisms (mDNS, DNS-SD)
;;    - Integration with system firewall
;;    - Log integration with system logging
;;    - Monitoring and metrics collection
